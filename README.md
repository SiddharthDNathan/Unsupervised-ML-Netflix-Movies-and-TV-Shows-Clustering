# Unsupervised-ML-Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
The goal of this project is to analyze the Netflix catalog of movies and TV shows, which was sourced from the third-party search engine Flixable, and group them into relevant clusters. This will aid in enhancing the user experience and prevent subscriber churn for the world's largest online streaming service provider, Netflix, which currently boasts over 220 million subscribers as of 2022-Q2. The dataset, which includes movies and TV shows as of 2019, will be analyzed to uncover new insights and trends in the rapidly growing world of streaming entertainment.
